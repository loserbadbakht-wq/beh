/**
* **Default audio/video track selection on src load / unselect on src unload.**
* When a presentation is resolved, sets `selectedVideoTrackId` /
* `selectedAudioTrackId` from a per-type default rule chain if no selection
* already exists. When the presentation is unset/reset (transitions back to unresolved),
* clears the selection so a stale id from the previous source doesn't persist.
*
* Lifecycle-driven: the pick fires once per transition, and nothing re-picks —
* that is what separates these from the `switch*` variants. External writes (user
* picks, ABR, programmatic filter-driven re-picks) are left alone, including a
* write naming a track the manifest never offered.
*
* The one thing policed between transitions is a pick the *constraints* turn
* against: a rendition's container and encryption are only known once its media
* playlist resolves, which is after the pick was made, so a selection that becomes
* unplayable is dropped. Dropped, never moved — re-picking is exactly the behavior
* `switchVideoTrack` exists to provide. Dropping reports nothing on its own, since
* whatever made the pick unplayable already reported its own, more specific cause.
*
* Selection runs the same rule model `switchVideoTrack` does — a hard
* `constraints` pre-pass, then an ordered `rules` chain, with the pick as the
* head (see `internal/design/spf/track-switching-model.md`). What differs is
* reactivity, not the rules: this evaluates the chain once on resolve and pins
* the result, where `switchVideoTrack` re-evaluates inside an effect so its rules
* subscribe to bandwidth and user selection. A rule written for one therefore
* composes into the other unchanged.
*
* Both are config-driven, each per-type export wiring a sensible default: audio's
* three-tier language policy, and for video the *empty* chain — with nothing
* narrowing or reordering, the head is the first candidate. The behavior's
* `config` is forwarded to the rules, so options like `preferredAudioLanguage`
* reach them without an intermediate layer.
*
* Note a rule can only pick among real candidates, where the picker it replaced
* could return any id at all. An id absent from the manifest was never
* selectable, so that narrowing is the point rather than a limitation.
*
* Compose `selectVideoTrack` for the simple "pick a default video track"
* behavior, or `switchVideoTrack` (`./track-switching.ts`) for the
* ABR-driven variant. Compose `selectAudioTrack` for the simple default
* pick, or `switchAudioTrack` (`./track-switching.ts`) for the
* filter-reactive + mid-stream-flush slot-owner variant — when audio-abr
* lands, `switchAudioTrack` extends into `switchAudioQuality`. Compose
* only one per type — they're alternatives, not stackable (each writes
* the same `selected*TrackId` slot). The simple variants tree-shake out
* the heavier machinery (bandwidth estimator, quality selection, flush
* orchestration).
*
* Text selection has no simple variant here — it's owned by `switchTextTrack`
* (`./track-switching.ts`), which resolves standing `userTextTrackSelection`
* intent against the constrained, CDN-scoped renditions.

* - **No rendition fits**, on a screen smaller than the whole ladder. `applyRules`

* rather than a spurious call.
*

*
* - **`screen`'s own `change`** — the screen itself being reconfigured, or the

*   catches a window moving between two same-size, same-ratio displays. From the
*   Window Management API, but on the base `Screen` rather than behind
*   `getScreenDetails()`, so it needs no permission — only a secure context.
*   Measured present in Chromium and absent in WebKit and Firefox, hence the
*   three below rather than this alone.
* - **`resize`** — the window changing size, which is also what the OS does to it
*   when the display it was on goes away.
* - **`screen.orientation` change** — rotation, which swaps the axes without
*   necessarily resizing the window.
* - **a `(resolution: <ratio>dppx)` media query** (`watchDevicePixelRatio`) — the
*   device pixel ratio changing under a window that kept its size, which is the
*   cross-display drag between displays of different density.
*
*   Worth keeping despite looking redundant, because it is the only coverage that
*   case has in WebKit and Firefox: neither implements `screen`'s change event,
*   and the drag doesn't resize the window. It is also a cleaner signal in Safari
*   than elsewhere — WebKit holds `devicePixelRatio` independent of page zoom, so
*   there it moves only on a real density change, where Chromium and Gecko fold
*   zoom into it as well.
*
* ⚠️ Known gap, on engines without `screen`'s change event: dragging a window
* between two different-size displays that share a ratio, without the window
* resizing, changes the reading with nothing firing. Closing it there would mean
* polling, whose interval and battery cost are a policy decision this function

*
* An `EventTarget`, because a Media is one: the store and the element layers
* take anything they attach as an event source, and inheriting the three methods
* satisfies that for free rather than by stubbing them.
*
* ⚠️ It still implements too little to carry the rest of the media surface, which
* bounds what may consume it: a store feature reading a property outside this set
* gets `undefined` rather than an error. A Media needing more of that surface
* belongs on a host that provides it.

* natively. This one streams HLS through the engine, which pins a single
* rendition for the session rather than adapting, and drops audio and text
* handling entirely — the shape an ambient hero video actually wants.
*
* Nearer an image than a player, and `src` is the whole surface. Replaces the
* standalone `mux-background-video` package, whose `audio`, `debug`, `preload`,
* and `max-resolution` attributes are all deliberately absent. Capping which
* rendition is fetched is a delivery param on the URL — `?max_resolution=720p`
* on a Mux stream, for one — which keeps the renditions it excludes out of the
* manifest rather than merely unpicked; `preload` would have nothing to say,
* since the engine loads from the moment it has a source. And unlike
* `<background-video>` there are no `nomuted` / `noloop` / `noautoplay` opt-outs:
* those three are what this element is for, so the adapter fixes them on at
* attach.
*
* Takes no structured `source` — `src` is an HLS URL, as the package it replaces
* required. Mux playback-ID identity, poster, and storyboard belong to
* `<mux-video>`; none of them mean anything without controls to hang them on.
*
* Nothing about an unplayable source reaches the inner `<video>` on its own, so
* `error` on it stays null and the element sits at `readyState 0`. The engine
* reports each condition and logs it, the Media promotes the fatal one, and this
* element re-fires it as its own `error` / `'error'` — the one place a consumer
* holding the element can see a source that never appears.
*
* @fires error - Fired when a fatal condition is reported. Read `error` for it.
*
* `<mux-background-video>` is this element under the name the package it replaces
* used. Same class, so the tag is a naming choice and nothing more.
*
* @example
* ```html
* <hls-background-video src="https://stream.mux.com/PLAYBACK_ID.m3u8?max_resolution=720p">
*   <img src="https://image.mux.com/PLAYBACK_ID/thumbnail.webp?time=0" alt="" />
