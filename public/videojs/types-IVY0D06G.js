* Canonical values for {@link MediaStreamType}.
*
* - `ON_DEMAND` — a finite-duration asset (VOD). Scrubbing is generally supported across the full timeline.
* - `LIVE` — a live or DVR stream. The seekable window may slide as new segments are published, and `duration` is
*   typically `Infinity`.
* - `UNKNOWN` — the stream type has not been determined yet (no source, or metadata has not loaded).
