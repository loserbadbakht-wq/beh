* for, a pick outside them could never play — constraint semantics ("can't play here"), not preference. Removes the
* candidates whose codec-family set doesn't _equal_ the selected track's (set-equality so a muxed `hvc1,mp4a` rendition
* can't pass as a match for `avc1,mp4a` on its audio half). Purely relational: the lock _is_ the current selection's
* families, no state of its own. Pruned pre-pass, a cross-family user selection mid-stream never reaches the user
* filter, which falls through unhonored instead of killing playback. Before any selection exists (the initial pick) it
* removes nothing, which is what leaves the initial family choice to the rule chain (user intent, then
* `preferCodecFamilies`).
*
* The selected track's families come from the _presentation's_ track list, not the already-pruned candidates: a CDN
* entering cooldown may prune the current track itself while same-family renditions survive on another host, and the
* lock must carry over to them. Removes nothing when: no selection yet, a selection the presentation no longer carries,
* or a selected track without codecs (then no candidate's compatibility is decidable — same inertness as
* `preferCodecFamilies` on a codec-less ladder).
*
* When the selected family genuinely vanishes from the playable set, the pre-pass empties: the behavior reports the
* type's no-supported-track code and clears the selection — an explicable stop instead of a cross-family append
* surfacing as an opaque decode error. Clearing also releases the lock (it keys on the live selection), so a following
* pick may land in the surviving family on freshly-created buffer actors; whether the append layer survives that
* rebuild is the changeType gap, out of this constraint's hands. If `changeType` support ever lands, this constraint is
* what relaxes.
*
* Reading the selection here — a slot the picking effect itself writes, from inside the candidate-set computed — is
* safe only because the effect scheduler revalidates an effect's sources after each run; see `core/signals/effect.ts`
* (`revalidateSources`) for the lost-wakeup it prevents.

/**
* **Bridge MSE playback to AirPlay on WebKit.** MSE streams can't be handed to an AirPlay receiver directly. The
* WebKit-recommended workaround is to append a fallback `<source type="application/x-mpegURL">` carrying the original
* manifest URL: Safari exposes the AirPlay picker and, when a wireless target is selected, plays that native-HLS source
* on the receiver. The session state (WebKit's wireless flag, falling edge debounced — see `REMOTE_INACTIVE_SETTLE_MS`)
* is written straight to its policy consequences, declared here so the cause→policy mapping stays with the feature:
*
* - `state.loadingSuspended` — held while the session is live. Observed by the `loadXSegments` dispatchers (no fetching
*   alongside the receiver) and by `setupMediaSource` (its post-close rebuild waits — attaching runs `element.load()`
*   under the live receiver, which destroys a session still being established). The suspension this behavior holds
*   doubles as its own session fact — same writer, same edges.
* - `state.startPosition` — one-shot command: the position is captured from the element at the session's settled end
*   (still receiver-mirrored) and written once the rebuild's `load()` resets the element (its `'emptied'`), so
*   `applyStartPosition` applies it to the rebuilt source — never to the pre-rebuild element — and starts it where the
*   receiver left off. The playing state rides the same snapshot but stays behavior-local: this behavior itself calls
*   `play()` once the command has been _consumed_ — i.e. after the seek — when the receiver was playing at session end.
*   The whole restore is bound to the presentation the session owned and retracted if that changes.
*
* A source change during a live session releases the hold rather than deferring until the session ends, so the rebuild
* runs and WebKit switches the receiver to the newly-built AirPlay alternate. Measured, not contracted — see the effect
* below. https://webkit.org/blog/15036/how-to-use-media-source-extensions-with-airplay/
*
* Single-positive-state reactor (`'preconditions-unmet'` ↔ `'airplay-capable'`): gated on a WebKit-AirPlay-capable
* media element being in scope. The entry — gated on `context.mediaSource` — appends the fallback `<source>` (kept
* current from `state.presentation`) and enables the AirPlay picker once the MediaSource is open, removing the source
* the moment the MediaSource detaches so it never survives an MSE teardown. State-exit cleanup (author opt-out, detach,
* source reset, behavior destroy) removes the source and restores the element's `disableRemotePlayback` default. No-op
* on non-WebKit platforms (Chromium, Firefox) — `deriveState` never leaves `'preconditions-unmet'`.
*
* MMS and AirPlay want _opposite_ values of `disableRemotePlayback` on the same element, so it is **sequenced**:
*
* - **MMS needs `true` to open.** `setupMediaSource` sets `disableRemotePlayback = true` when it attaches a
*   ManagedMediaSource — Safari won't fire `sourceopen` (and MSE playback never starts) otherwise.
* - **AirPlay needs `false` to offer the picker.** Flipping to `false` _before_ the source opens would prevent
*   `sourceopen`, so the flip is gated on `context.mediaSource` — which `setupMediaSource` publishes exactly once the
*   MS is open. Re-fires per source (the slot clears + republishes on reset).
* - **Author opt-out wins.** `state.disableRemotePlayback` is the author's intent, written only by the media adapter's
*   IDL property; MMS/programmatic code touch the element's own `disableRemotePlayback` instead. A `true` there is
*   unambiguously the author's choice to disable remote playback, so it holds the machine in `'preconditions-unmet'`
*   and nothing is set up.

* **Start playback of a source at a requested position.** `state.startPosition` is a one-shot command — "when the

* `EXT-X-START`, resume-where-you-left-off, and MediaSource-recovery restore build on). Consumers (adapters,
* `setupAirPlay`'s session-end snapshot) write it; this behavior is its sole consumer and clears it after applying, so
* a stale position can never replay against a later source or rebuild.
*
* Single-positive-state reactor (`'preconditions-unmet'` ↔ `'position-pending'`): gated on `mediaElement + resolved
* presentation + startPosition` defined. The entry applies the command in two steps:
*
* 1. **Seed `state.currentTime` immediately.** The segment loaders anchor their load window on `state.currentTime`;
*    seeding points the _first_ fetches at the requested position instead of 0. Multi-writer with `trackCurrentTime`
*    (ongoing DOM mirror) — legitimate: different decision domains (element-derived mirror vs one-shot command), and
*    before HAVE_METADATA no `timeupdate`/`seeking` fires to overwrite the seed. Compose this behavior _after_
*    `trackCurrentTime` so the seed lands after the mirror's attach-time sync.
* 2. **Seek the element at metadata.** `element.currentTime = position` once `readyState >= HAVE_METADATA` (immediately if
*    already there, else on `loadedmetadata`), then clear `startPosition` (consume). The element clamps the seek to its
*    seekable range per spec, and the resulting `seeking` event flows back through `trackCurrentTime` — from here the
*    ordinary seek path owns the position.
*
* Position only — playing/paused is deliberately out of scope. The media element load algorithm forces `paused = true`,
* so a source that was playing before a rebuild comes back paused at the restored position; resume intent belongs to
* whoever commands the start (e.g. `setupAirPlay` restores its session-end playing state itself).
*
* Deliberately NOT relying on the pre-metadata "default playback start position" write (setting `currentTime` at
* HAVE_NOTHING): cross-browser MSE behavior there is inconsistent; the explicit `loadedmetadata` sequencing is
* deterministic everywhere.
*
* State-exit cleanup (source reset, element detach, destroy) drops the pending `loadedmetadata` listener. An
* _unapplied_ command survives a source reset — "start the source I'm loading at P" holds while the presentation routes
* through unresolved — but is consumed the moment it applies.

* Decode-time origin extraction from fMP4/CMAF segments.
*
* Non-zero-PTS sources encode media at a non-zero start time (an instant clip starting at asset second 60, an Apple
* bipbop asset starting at 10s, …). To relocate such a source onto a 0-based presentation timeline via
* `SourceBuffer.timestampOffset`, the engine needs that start time — the **decode-time origin** — read straight from
* the container:
*
* - `tfdt.baseMediaDecodeTime` (from a media segment's `moof`) — the decode time of the segment's first sample, in the
*   track's media timescale. This is a DTS: relocating by `−(baseMediaDecodeTime / timescale)` lands the earliest DTS
*   at exactly 0, so a negative-DTS append failure on Chromium is impossible by construction.
* - `mdhd.timescale` (from the init segment's `moov`) — ticks per second for that track, needed to convert the raw tick
*   count to seconds.
*
* ## Presumptive vs. track-selected reads
*
* The two variants share only the leaf field-readers (`mdhd` timescale, `tfdt` baseMediaDecodeTime) and the box walker.
* Everything else differs, and the split is deliberate so the presumptive pair is _proportionally_ smaller under
* tree-shaking:
*
* - **Presumptive** — {@link readFirstMediaTimescale} / {@link readFirstBaseMediaDecodeTime} read the first `mdhd`
*   timescale and first `tfdt` baseMediaDecodeTime. There's no `track_id` (nothing to match against) and no
*   `trak`/`traf` iteration — a direct `findBox` to the first leaf. Correct when the init/segment holds a single media
*   track (the common CMAF case). A caption-free platform imports only this pair and tree-shakes away all the matching
*   machinery below.
* - **Track-selected** — {@link findMediaTrack} / {@link readBaseMediaDecodeTime}. `findMediaTrack` returns `{ trackId,
*   timescale }` for the `trak` whose `hdlr` handler matches; `readBaseMediaDecodeTime` takes that `trackId` and reads
*   the `traf` whose `tfhd.track_id` matches. The `track_id` is the join that ties one track's timescale to the _same_
*   track's baseMediaDecodeTime — required when a source muxes CEA-608/708 captions (a `clcp` track shares the same
*   `moov` and `moof`, each track with its own timescale + baseMediaDecodeTime, so a presumptive read there risks
*   `300000 / 6000 = 50s` instead of `60000 / 6000 = 10s`). This pair adds `trak`/`traf` iteration plus the handler and
*   `track_id` reads. We only ever ask for buffered media handlers (`vide` / `soun`); the caption track is never
*   selected — we read the origin, not the captions (caption _rendering_ is out of scope).
*
* Both raw values are returned un-divided to leave room for an edit-list (`elst`) presentation-time correction term if
* a source ever carries one — the validated streams do not.
