* Call `onChange` with the new ratio whenever `devicePixelRatio` changes.
*
* `devicePixelRatio` fires no change event, so the ratio is watched through a
* `(resolution: …dppx)` media query. Each query only answers about the ratio it
* was built for, so it reports a single change and the handler builds the next.
* `once: true` is what keeps that from accumulating listeners: the fired one is
* gone before the replacement is armed. Same shape as MDN's snippet for this,
* whose earlier non-re-arming version fired exactly once and stopped.
*
* Worth watching separately from an element's size: browser zoom, or dragging
* the window to a display with a different ratio, changes the ratio without
* resizing the element.
*
* @param onChange - Called with the new `devicePixelRatio` after each change
* @param signal - Optional, for a caller that tears every subscription down
* through one signal rather than a handle each; aborting it stops the watching
* @returns Cleanup that detaches the armed query
