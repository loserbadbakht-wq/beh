/**
* Apply `scale` to a size and normalize it to whole pixels, or `undefined` where
* that leaves nothing to describe.
*
* Rounded because pixels are whole and a fractional scale doesn't divide a
* surface evenly. A non-positive or non-finite axis yields `undefined` rather
* than a zero-area reading: an element that isn't being rendered reports `0 × 0`
* and a nonsense dimension reports `NaN`, and the caps consuming this read
* absence as "unknown, don't cap" while an area of zero would read as a cap of
* zero — pinning every source to its smallest rendition.
*
* @param size - Dimensions to project, in the units `scale` converts from
* @param scale - Multiplier for both axes, e.g. `devicePixelRatio`; defaults to 1
* @returns The scaled, whole-pixel resolution, or `undefined` when either axis
* doesn't survive it
