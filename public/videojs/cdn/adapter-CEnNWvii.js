* it unchanged — the video Media over the full HLS engine, the audio-only Media
* over the subtractive one. A mixin rather than a shared base class because each
* flavor extends a different SPF Media, so there is no common class to put this
* on, only a common `src` accessor to write through.
*
* Unlike the hls.js-backed `MuxMedia`, there is no inherited `source` to
* delegate to — the SPF Medias know only `src` — so this owns the structured
* source and dispatches `sourcechange` itself.
*
* @fires sourcechange - Fired when `source` changes, either directly or by parsing a new `src`. Read `source` for the new value.
* @fires contentdatachange - Fired when the derived `contentData` changes. Read `contentData` for the new value.
